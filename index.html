<h1>If You Pass This Quiz You Are A Legend<br>Level 1 - General Knowledge</h1>
<p>There are a few rules and tips.<br><br>
RULES: You are not allowed to look anything up. The only exception is if you do not know how to spell a team's name. If you need to look something up for spelling, smh. No asking anybody else for help. This includes friends, family, people who are not your friends, and people who are not part of your family. NO OUTSIDE HELP. You may attempt as many times as you would like but if you fail on level 2 or 3, you must restart at level 1.<br>TIPS: Type the player's full name when asked about a player or a team's full name when asked about a team. Spelling matters so don't go too fast. CAPITALIZE! This quiz is case sensitive so use those uppercase letters. ex. LeBron, Tom, LeSean.<br>Good luck, you'll need it</p>
